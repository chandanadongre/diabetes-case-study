**#Diabetes Case Study Mini ML Project**
**#Overview**
This mini machine learning project focuses on predicting diabetes progression in patients using a linear regression model. The dataset used in this project contains various features such as age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and others, which are utilized to predict the progression of diabetes over time.

**Dataset**
diabetes-case-study.csv
(referred a dataset from kaggle)

**Dependencies**
This project requires the following Python libraries:
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
These dependencies can be installed via pip: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

**Files**
diabetes.csv: The dataset file containing the diabetes data.
diabetes_linear_regression.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using linear regression.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

**Results**
The linear regression model trained on the diabetes dataset achieves an MAE=0.3388 , MSE=0.16193, RMSE=0.40240 and R2 Score=0.29283 on the test data, indicating moderate predictive performance. Further analysis and improvements could be explored to enhance the model's accuracy and interpretability.

**Conclusion**
This mini project demonstrates the application of a linear regression model for predicting diabetes progression based on patient features. It serves as a starting point for more sophisticated analyses and model development in the field of medical data science.
